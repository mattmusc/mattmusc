Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matteo Muscella and I am a software developer experienced in web and mobile development.

I have experience with PHP, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript and Flutter. I have experience also with web technologies like Angular and React.
I like to learn new technologies, programming languages and frameworks to develop software solutions.
